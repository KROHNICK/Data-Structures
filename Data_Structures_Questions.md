10. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.delete`? Constant

    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the JS `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?

    the delete runs faster than the array, difference changes as the size gets bigger
